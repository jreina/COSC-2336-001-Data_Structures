#include <iostream>

/*
 * PF3
 *
 *  Put your solution to this lab in ~/PF3/lab1/lab1.cpp
 *
 *  NOTE:  In your output statements, display not only
 *  the requested data, but also show how the value was
 *  passed to cout.  For instance, if asked to display
 *  the value of the variable "j", your print statement
 *  should look like
 *
 *
 *      cout << "j = " << j << endl;
 *
 *  If you have to insert '&' or '*' in front of any varible
 *  to satisfy the output request, put the symbol in the string
 *  literal so that I can see what you did from your output.
